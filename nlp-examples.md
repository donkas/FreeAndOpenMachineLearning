NLP Business Examples
=====================

NLP enabled application make a good fit for businesses where analysing
or processing text is done at large. Below some example NLP business use
cases.

-   Social media monitoring:Almost all social media monitoring tools are
    basically built using NLP technology. These tools help to monitor
    social media channels for mentions of your brand, and alert you when
    consumers are talking about your brand. Real time monitoring of
    social media channels is important for companies for a lot of large
    companies, e.g. to ensure that any potential crises is noticed
    immediately.
-   Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis is a smaller subset of social
    media monitoring. It refers to monitoring the social media landscape
    and listening in on conversations and identifying opinions and
    determining whether the author of the post holds a positive,
    negative, or neutral opinion towards a brand. Using NLP sentiment
    analysis tools is it easy to filter emotionally-charged words that
    are used to describe a brand or a customer's experience with a
    brand. It is also possible to automate research on how consumers
    speak about a product or service.
-   Text analysis: Text analysis can be broken into several
    sub-categories e.g. grammatical, syntactic and semantic analyses. By
    analysing text and extracting different types of key elements (such
    as topics, people, dates, locations, companies), it is easier to
    organize data and identify useful patterns and insights.
-   Survey analytics: If you are analysing large amounts of surveys you
    can use old-skool reporting and statistical techniques. But a NLP
    based analyse makes it possible to faster and easier find patterns,
    categories and anomalies that are hard to find manual in survey
    responses with more than 20.000 responses.
-   Spam filters: Emails that contain text and words such as "free",
    "promotion", "buy now" , \'coin\' , \'offer\' , etc, have a high
    chance of being spam. With the use of NLP technology you can create
    self learning spam filters. Sometimes too good.
-   Autocomplete: With an autocomplete function it is possible to
    predicts what the next characters or words will be that you will
    enter. This makes the use of text based UI simpler.
-   Hiring Tools: Large companies still do receive many resumes,
    analysing can be time-consuming and the task of sorting
    overwhelming. Natural language processing software is able to speed
    up the process of sorting resumes. But be aware NLP software is not
    flawless. So you will miss good candidates if you only scan resumes.
-   Conversational Search: Traditional search often brings not the
    results you want. Wit conversational search the context of your
    search is taken into account. So only for the current context
    relevant search items will be presented. Since searching quality
    information is time consuming , streamlining search in real-time
    conversation NLP software will improve productivity for knowledge
    workers.
