AllenNLP
========

An open-source NLP research library, built on PyTorch. AllenNLP is a NLP
research library, built on PyTorch, for developing state-of-the-art deep
learning models on a wide variety of linguistic tasks. AllenNLP makes it
easy to design and evaluate new deep learning models for nearly any NLP
problem, along with the infrastructure to easily run them in the cloud
or on your laptop.

AllenNLP was designed with the following principles:

-   *Hyper-modular and lightweight.* Use the parts which you like
    seamlessly with PyTorch.
-   *Extensively tested and easy to extend.* Test coverage is above 90%
    and the example models provide a template for contributions.
-   *Take padding and masking seriously*, making it easy to implement
    correct models without the pain.
-   *Experiment friendly.* Run reproducible experiments from a json
    specification with comprehensive logging.

Apache OpenNLP
==============

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text.

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference
resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text
processing services. OpenNLP also included maximum entropy and
perceptron based machine learning.

The goal of the OpenNLP project will be to create a mature toolkit for
the abovementioned tasks. An additional goal is to provide a large
number of pre-built models for a variety of languages, as well as the
annotated text resources that those models are derived from.

Apache Tika
===========

The Apache Tika™ toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from
over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of
these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika
useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and
much more.

Several wrappers are available to use Tika in another programming
language, such as [Julia](https://github.com/aviks/Taro.jl) or
[Python](https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python)
